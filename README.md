### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm an IT student from Lodz University of Technology in Poland :trophy:. 

- ðŸ”­ In my free time, I'm passionately developing a 2D/3D Game Engine, continuously refining it through solo experimentation and collaborative efforts in game jams.

## Projects

- ### High Performance Game Engine and Editor
In-development game engine built entirely in C++, with a custom OpenGL renderer and high-performance ECS architecture for streamlined development. Additionally, the engine features a native C# (.NET 8.0) scripting engine for flexibility, along with comprehensive editor/runtime support and a GUI editor powered by ImGui. With a strong focus on performance and utilizing a range of libraries, including ENTT, Box2D, glm math, stb, and more.

- ### SLAM-based Point Cloud Generation, 3D Triangle Mesh Visualizator (KISS-ICP expansion)
Software able to convert recorded, dynamic point cloud data captured by a moving robot gathering data using LiDAR into a seamless triangle mesh. Developed using C++ and python, leveraging advanced libraries such as Eigen, TBB, Sophus, and with help of KISS-ICP project, this software offers lightning-fast real-time calculations and visualization of the generated mesh in a 3D environment.
